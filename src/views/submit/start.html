## Before you start

### Publish data on your website

Your data must be on a URL the public can access. We collect the latest data from there every day.

You must link to that URL from a webpage about the data. This needs to be on your official planning authority website,
usually ending in gov.uk.

The webpage must include, for each dataset:

- the link to the data URL
- a summary of what the data is about
- a statement that the data is provided under the Open Government Licence
